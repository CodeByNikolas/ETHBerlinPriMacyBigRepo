# ETHBerlinPriMacyBigRepo

This Repo contains three Repos that each serve a different puspose.
they can be found in the folders and seperately when you search for the github links:
https://github.com/CodeByNikolas/ETHBFrontEnd

https://github.com/CodeByNikolas/EthBBackend

https://github.com/tobias-rothmann/MP-SPDZ-MACI

###Each repo has their own readme

The Backend is used to deploy the smart contracts on Sepolia.

The Frontend is used to build and deploy the website, as it can be seen here:
https://bitebitebie.vercel.app/

The MP-SPDZ-MACI Repo is used for the Multi party computation that is used to replace the trusted Coordinator

### challenges: running and adapting MACI to MPC; conversion of cryptogrphic primitives to MPC circuits; understanding MPC dsl;

###problem we solve: eliminating the need to trust into public parties and private voting with MACI

###technology used: MPC (Multi-party computation), eliptic curve cryptography, Poseidon-hash based encryption

-   Technology: MACI Protocol (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure)
